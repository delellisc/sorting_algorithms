# Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project is an assignment for a data structures course with the objective of comparing the performance of six different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. The comparison was conducted by implementing these algorithms in a C++ script, executing them, measuring their time efficiency, processing the results, and presenting them in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@delellis021/8f8df746bd9f).

## C++ script

We created a C++ script to execute all six algorithms using random vectors of varying sizes. The script measures the time taken by each algorithm to sort the random vector and writes the results to a .csv file.

To compile the script after cloning the repository, use:

```g++ sorting_algorithms.cpp```

And then you can run the compiled executable from the repository folder with:

```./a```

## Data processing with notebook

After executing the script and obtaining the .csv output file, we used Google Colab to create a notebook. This notebook was used to process the data, generate plots that were used in the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@delellis021/8f8df746bd9f) and aid us in our analysis.
