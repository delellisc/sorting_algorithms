# Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project is an assignment for a data structures course with the objective of comparing the performance of six different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. The comparison was conducted by implementing these algorithms in a C++ script, executing them, measuring their time efficiency, processing the results, and presenting them in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@delellis021/8f8df746bd9f).

## C++ script

We created a [C++ script](https://github.com/delellisc/sorting_algorithms/blob/main/sorting_algorithms.cpp) to execute all six algorithms using random vectors of varying sizes. The script measures the time taken by each algorithm to sort the random vector and writes the results to a .csv file.

To compile the script after cloning the repository, use:

```g++ sorting_algorithms.cpp```

And then you can run the compiled executable from the repository folder with:

```./a```

## Data processing with notebook

After executing the script and obtaining the .csv output file, we used Google Colab to create a [notebook](https://github.com/delellisc/sorting_algorithms/blob/main/notebook/sorting_algorithms.ipynb). This notebook was used to process the data, generate plots that were used in the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@delellis021/8f8df746bd9f) and aid us in our analysis.

All of our thought processes are described in our article and our notebook, so we didn't feel the need to describe them again here.
